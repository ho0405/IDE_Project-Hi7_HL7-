# Project Setup Instructions

## Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Follow the instructions specified in the backend's README.md to set up the backend environment.

## Frontend Setup

You can set up the frontend locally or access it through a hosted version. Follow the instructions below based on your preference.

### Local Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

After running the above commands, the local development server will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Using Hosted Frontend

If you prefer not to install the frontend locally, you can use the hosted version by visiting the following URL:
[https://frontend-hl7.vercel.app/](https://frontend-hl7.vercel.app/)

Feel free to try out the application through the hosted version if you're not ready to set up locally.
